<h3>There are two modes!!</h3>
<br>
<h3>- Normal Mode🍀 </h3>

<h3>- AI Mode 🖥️</h3>

### HOW TO USE NORMAL MODE
After you press space to start, Grab a friend,  (or you can play by yourself like me lol). The keys **A and D** is used to move the top player. The keys ◀️ ▶️ (left and right) is used to move the bottom player.  Whoever gets the ball to go to the oponenet side wins! :) 

### HOW TO USE AI PLAYER MODE
First you press space to start. Luckily you don't need a friend, you have your AI companion to play against you. Whoever gets the ball to go to the oponenet side wins!
